Everybody can make mistakes.

#### Contrast with impostor syndrome

#### Code reviews

#### Learning / asking for help

#### Admitting errors / failures

#### Helping others

#### Taking boring / annoying tasks

#### Take your colleague's wishes into account

#### Declaring bankruptcy on your memory

#### Work in peace / avoid burnout / avoiding angry moments
