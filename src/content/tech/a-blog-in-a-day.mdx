Lately I've been wanting
How I created a blog in 3 days, but with this information, you simply might do it in one.

## Blog features

The first thing that I like to do before any project is to annotate what are the minimum
requirements that the project needs. For me, those are the ones I wanted for my blog:
- A front page with job info
- A about page with social media links and info about me
- A tech and a personal blog page
- Blog posts should support [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
- Blog posts should support coding snippets
- Should be simple and practical to create and add posts
- Optionally, a dark theme
- Optionally, the possibility to add some custom code

Following the K.I.S.S. (keep it simple stupid) principle, and in an attempt to not follow
the "social media" trends, there is no need for "counters" here. No thumbs up, no comments,
just distraction-free content.

Although comments could be nice, I think it's double-edged in terms of advantages, and a
complicated thing to implement. I intend to publish my posts on other websites as well,
so any comments there are welcome.

## Implementation decisions

I think that for a dev like me, a [SSG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator)
website hosted on GH pages is very nice. It's free and has all the infrastructure that GH
already offers. No need for any fancy [CMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system)
or anything, besides, I want to be able to add some code in a blog post, and that would be
a pain to solve in any CMS, and at the end it would be the same results but with more
effort.

Trying to find a SSG website generator, I've found a few candidates for the job. There is 
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), [Gatsby](gatsbyjs.com), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
