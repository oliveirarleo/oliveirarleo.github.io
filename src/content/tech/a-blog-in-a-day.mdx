How I created a blog in 2 days, but with this information, you simply might do it in one.

## Blog features

The first thing that I like to do before any project is to annotate what are the minimum requirements that the project needs. For me, that's simple:
- A front page with job info
- A about page with social media links and info about me
- A tech and a personal blog page
- Blog posts should support markdown
- Blog posts should support coding snippets
- Should be simple and practical to create and add posts
- Optionally, the possibility to add some custom code 
- Optionally, a dark theme
